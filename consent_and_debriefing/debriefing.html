      <h2>Information about the study you just completed</h2>
      <h4>Thank you for your help today!</h4>
      <p>
        Very broadly, the purpose of this research is to investigate how what
        people see, hear, or imagine (e.g., color, shape, duration, motion,
        sounds, etc.) and what people experience and think (e.g., appearances,
        conscious awareness, judgment, confidence, decision- making, planning
        etc.) interact. Our experiences have both objective and subjective
        aspects, and we are trying to understand how they relate to each other.
        When looking at or imagining different objects, our minds interpret both
        its objective properties (e.g., color, shape, motion, etc.) and its
        subjective properties (e.g., how it looks to you from here at this
        particular moment, etc.). Importantly, our minds often perform cognitive
        operations on these perceptual experiences when we evaluate them: Was I
        aware of the stimulus? How well am I remembering what I saw? How
        confident am I that I judged its perceptual properties correctly? What
        strategies could I use for more accurately classifying these stimuli?
        Are my general strategies in engaging with this stimulus effective or
        novel enough? By relating these subjective and objective properties of
        our experiences, we are trying to understand better how our minds make
        sense of the environment, and how our experiences relate to some of
        mental capacities such as reasoning, deciding, imagining, remembering,
        and so on.

        Sometimes we use eye-tracking technology to make sure that we know what
        part of the screen participants are looking at as different aspects of
        what was seen may have attracted a participants’ gaze in different
        manner at different times of the study. Moreover, when we use
        eye-tracking we also look at the size of participants’ pupils since,
        sometimes, the size of the pupil is an indirect measure of how
        participants experienced our task (for example, when noticing something
        on the screen, the pupil may grow a little bit in size).
