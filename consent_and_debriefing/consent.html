          <p><b>Request to Participate in Research</b></p>
          <p>
            We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based online
            study. The survey is part of a research study whose purpose is to
            investigate how what you see, hear or imagine (e.g., color, shape,
            duration, motion, sounds, etc.) and what you experience and think
            (e.g., appearances, conscious awareness, judgment, confidence,
            decision-making, planning etc.) interact.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>Key Information </b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your consent is being sought for participation in a research
              project and your participation is voluntary.
            </li>
            <li>
              The purpose of the research is to understand people’s sensory
              perceptual experiences (things they see, things they hear, things
              they imagine, etc.), what they think about these experiences, and
              to measure decisions they make based on those experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              The anticipated amount of time that your participation will take
              will be between 1 and 120 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>The procedures that you will be asked to complete will be:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sit in front of your computer</li>
              <li>Look or listen to stimuli presented on the screen</li>
              <li>
                Use your imagination to picture certain images, sounds,
                sensations
              </li>
              <li>
                Press a key or use the mouse to tell us what you
                saw/heard/imagined
              </li>
              <li>
                Press a key or use the mouse to tell us what you think about
                what you saw/heard/imagined
              </li>
              <li>
                Press a key or use the mouse to tell us how you think you are
                doing in the task
              </li>
              <li>
                Answer some questions about your experience doing the task
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>In some versions of the task, we may:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ask you to turn on your camera (computer’s webcam) so that we
                can non-invasively measure your eyes and where they are pointing
                at on the screen. Your webcam will be activated to track your
                gaze (eye movements), pupil size, or broad shifts in your head
                direction. The eye tracker is calibrated at the beginning of the
                experiment (and every now and then throughout the experiment) by
                asking you to look at particular regions on the screen.
                Sometimes you will be asked to keep your eyes fixed on a
                particular object on the screen for very brief periods of time
                on each trial (e.g., a cross at the center of the screen). While
                other times you will be allowed to move your eyes freely. You
                will have to allow your browser to turn on your camera. You’ll
                then be able to see yourself in a small box in the corner of the
                screen. The eye tracker works in real time and all the data is
                processed on your computer while the algorithm assesses where
                you’re looking at. This means that at no time we will record a
                video of you and no video will be live streamed anywhere at any
                point.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              The possible risks or discomforts of the study are minimal. You
              may experience fatigue from doing a repetitive task (boredom).
            </li>
            <li>There are no potential benefits for you</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We are asking you to participate in this study
            <span id="recruitingMethod"></span> to help us better understand the
            human mind. You must be between 18 and 65 years old to take this
            survey and able to turn on your webcam.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary.
            You do not have to participate, and you can refuse to answer any
            question. Even if you begin the web-based online survey, you can
            stop at any time.

            The possible risks or discomforts of the study are minimal. You may
            experience is fatigue from doing a repetitive task (boredom). There
            will be some breaks built into the study.

            There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this

            perception, cognition and consciousness function.

            Your part in this study is anonymous to the researcher(s), unless
            you choose to include information in the open-ended questions that
            makes you identifiable. Your data will be handled in a confidential
            manner. In addition, because of the nature of web-based surveys, it
            is possible that respondents could be identified by the IP address
            or other electronic record associated with the response. Neither the
            researcher nor anyone involved with this survey will be recording
            those data. The only individually-identifying data we receive from
            your crowdsourcing platform or panel are your unique identifier and
            your country. Your data are also stored on your platform or panel’s
            servers, and the data there are subject to their respective Privacy
            Notice and Participation Agreements.

          <p>
            No reports or publications will use information that can identify
            you in any way or any individual as being of this project. The only
            indicators we will record are your age, gender, handedness, and
            whether you use corrective lenses or not. De-identified data (i.e.,
            your responses but not who provided them) will be shared with
            scientific collaborators and hosted on public data sharing websites
            (e.g., the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io).
